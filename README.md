# SIMDisasteR
## Overview
SIMDisasteR is a hybrid Simulation Modelling framework for operation and coordination of Agencies Involved Disaster response and recovery. The model uses Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and System Dynamics (SD) modeling techniques to facilitate modeling the post-disaster response and recovery of the community and the involved entities, including the primary Emergency Support Functions (ESFs)[^1] be delivered to the population, the leading agencies involved in providing those ESFs, and the consequent macro level effects such as the state of health, housing, and security in the aftermath of a disaster.

The model is implemented in Python using <a href=”https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial”>BPTK-Py</a>, a platform for haybrid modeling using Agent-based Modeling and System Dynamics.

[^1]: Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) are defined as the primary coordinating structures used by governments to respond to the incidents and natural hazards.

## Disclaimer
It should be noted that the aim of SIMDisasteR is not to provide an accurate forecast of the post-earthquake state of the community under these scenarios. Simulation models often cannot accurately predict the complete interaction and cooperation of responsible agencies in the post-disaster response and recovery of the community because it is impossible to accurately model the behaviors of various system components in such large and complex systems. SIMDisasteR can provide a valuable analysis tool for policymakers and disaster management authorities to evaluate various coordination mechanisms and characterize the impacts of neglecting organizational duties.
