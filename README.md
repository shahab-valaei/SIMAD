## About SIMDisasteR
SIMDisasteR is a hybrid Simulation Modelling framework for operation and coordination of Agencies Involved Disaster response and recovery. The model is aimed to facilitate modeling the post-disaster response and recovery of the community and the involved entities, including the primary Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) <sup>1</sup> be delivered to the population, the leading agencies involved in providing those ESFs, and several dynamic phenomena forming as a result of the interaction between the population and agencies. 


<sup>1</sup> Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) are defined as the primary coordinating structures used by governments to respond to the incidents and natural hazards.
